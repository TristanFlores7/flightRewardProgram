- This project was designed to read a file that gives a passengers ID, specifies whether the passengers flight was canceled, and if so, if the passenger complained.
- Passengers who don't complain when their flight is canceled stack reward points.
- When a Passenger reaches a certain threshold of reward points, they enter a certain tier of membership, granting the passenger certain benifits, like free miles.
- The input file is read given the following format:
101 Y N
107 Y N
101 Y Y
112 N
103 Y Y
121 Y N
101 N
105 N
106 N
106 Y Y
  ...
- Where the number is the passenger's ID, the following character is whether the passenger's flight was canceled, and the following character if there is one is whether the passenger complained.
